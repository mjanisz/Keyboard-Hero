Keyboard-Hero
=============

My old HTML5 uni assignment, ported to an easy working engine

This game is based on the engine from tutorials by Rezoner.
Play on chrome (Sry FF, start allowing mp3!) !

Enjoy!

=============

It's not perferct, I just wanted to test out those tutorials, and increase my objective JS knowledge
Of course there should be some improvements, like creating a proper button engine for loading different songs based on their bpm, loading the song with ajax, 
different resolutions and mobile support etc etc ;)

=============

When I'll get some more time later I'll polish it a bit more - I promise ;)
